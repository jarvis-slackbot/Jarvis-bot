  <p><br>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, 
     resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud 
     computing easier for developers.</br></br>
     Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure 
	 capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your 
	 computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment. 
	 Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to 
	 minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing 
	 requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to 
	 pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools 
	 to build failure resilient applications and isolate them from common failure scenarios.

   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td><h3>Elastic Web-Scale Computing</h3>Amazon EC2 enables you to increase or decrease capacity within minutes, 
	     not hours or days. You can commission one, hundreds, or even thousands of server 
	     instances simultaneously. Because this is all controlled with web service APIs, 
	     your application can automatically scale itself up and down depending on its needs.</td>
     <td><h3>Completely Controlled</h3>You have complete control of your instances including root access and the ability 
	     to interact with them as you would any machine. You can stop any instance while 
		 retaining the data on the boot partition, and then subsequently restart the same 
		 instance using web service APIs. Instances can be rebooted remotely using web service 
		 APIs, and you also have access to their console output.</td>
	 <td><h3>Flexible Cloud Hosting Services</h3>You have the choice of multiple instance types, operating systems, and software packages. 
	     Amazon EC2 allows you to select a configuration of memory, CPU, instance storage, and the 
		 boot partition size that is optimal for your choice of operating system and application. 
		 For example, choice of operating systems includes numerous Linux distributions and Microsoft 
		 Windows Server.</td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td><h3>Integrated</h3>Amazon EC2 is integrated with most AWS services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service 
	     (Amazon S3), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Virtual Private 
	     Cloud (Amazon VPC) to provide a complete, secure solution for computing, query processing, 
	     and cloud storage across a wide range of applications.</td>
     <td><h3>Reliable</h3>Amazon EC2 offers a highly reliable environment where replacement instances can be rapidly 
	     and predictably commissioned. The service runs within Amazon’s proven network infrastructure 
		 and data centers. The Amazon EC2 Service Level Agreement commitment is 99.95% availability for 
		 each Amazon EC2 Region.</td>
	 <td><h3>Secure</h3>Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you will benefit from a 
	     data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most 
		 security-sensitive organizations. Amazon EC2 works in conjunction with Amazon VPC to provide 
		 security and robust networking functionality for your compute resources.</td>

     <td><h3>Inexpensive</h3>Amazon EC2 passes on to you the financial benefits of Amazon’s scale. You pay a very low rate 
	     for the compute capacity you actually consume. See Amazon EC2 Instance Purchasing Options for 
		 more details.</td>
     <td><h3>Easy to Start</h3>There are several ways to get started with Amazon EC2. You can use the AWS Management Console, 
	     the AWS Command Line Tools (CLI), or AWS SDKs. AWS is free to get started. To learn more, 
		 please visit our tutorials.</td>
