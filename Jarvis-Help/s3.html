  <p><br>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is object storage with a simple web service interface 
     to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is designed to deliver 
	 99.999999999% durability, and scale past trillions of objects worldwide.</br></br>
     Customers use S3 as primary storage for cloud-native applications; as a bulk repository, or 
	 "data lake," for analytics; as a target for backup & recovery and disaster recovery; and with 
	 serverless computing.</br></br>
     It's simple to move large volumes of data into or out of Amazon S3 with Amazon's cloud data 
	 migration options. Once data is stored in S3, it can be automatically tiered into lower cost, 
	 longer-term cloud storage classes like S3 Standard - Infrequent Access and Amazon Glacier for 
	 archiving.</br>
